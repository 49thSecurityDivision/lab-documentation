# Lab Trolls
## Processes
Everything we will discuss/maintain that relates to the lab will be here on github.
### Github
- Issues
  - First thing is when we have anything to do it will always be an issue
  - all issues will be attached to a project
  - when creating an issue try to make it into smaller tasks so you can incrementally accomplish your tasks
- Projects
  - Location
    - All projects should be created at the [Organization 
level](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-project-board/#creating-an-organization-wide-project-board) so that 
way we can add issues cross from all lab repos
    - When creating the project make sure to preface the board name with `Lab: `
  - style: the project boards will be in a kanbanish style that is displayed below. Always keep those same columns 
titles.
    - to-do - issues that are long term project or the "backlog"
      - automated to add new issues from the lab repo
    - On deck - what you are doing the next 2 week sprint
    - In progress - what you are currently doing this 2 week sprint
    - Done - when you have closed an issue
- Milestones
  - these will be how we organize our sprints
  - we will include all the issues in the in progress from all project
  - we will set a two week deadline
  - there will be a review of what was accomplished and what will be upcoming during the next Lab Troll convening.
- Documentation
  - all documentation needs to have an issue submitted so we can discuss how much/what needs to be documented
  - need to create an issue from the [issue 
template](https://github.com/49thSecurityDivision/lab/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) and we will discuss how it 
will fit into the wiki.
